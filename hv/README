<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
A modern web browser consists of a set of complimentary technologies, each one
implemented according to a standard specified formally or informally. For
example:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML and CSS
  <li>HTTP (and it's cousin HTTPS)
  <li>FTP
  <li>Javascript platform
  <li>MIME
  <li>Netscape Plugin API (npapi)
</ul>

<p>
As well as technologies aspiring to the same prominence, the web is crowded
with pretenders to the positions occupied by each of these. Yet it remains a
true statement that a competitive modern browser could be created by assembling
a credible set of implementations of the above. A truly open web browser
project would provide a set of reusable components to serve the above purposes
allowing the creators of web browser applications to focus on the user
interface.
