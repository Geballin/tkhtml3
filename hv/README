Demo Application hv3

	This file describes the Tkhtml demo application hv3, implemented in
	the *.tcl files in this directory. The acronmym 'hv' stands for
	"Html Viewer" (inventive eh?). The '3' indicates Tkhtml version 3.

Functionality

	hv3 is a minimalist web-browser script that uses Tkhtml. The idea
	is to have just enough functionality to test Tkhtml, but it's not
	supposed to be usable as a real browser. The target feature (not
	complete at time of writing) set is:

		* Support for http:// and file::// URIs.
		* Ability to load a new document, either by clicking on a
		  hyper-link or by entering a URI.
		* Support for anchors in documents (i.e. URIs like: 
		  index.html#part1).
		* Support for images, both as replaced objects and in other
		  roles.
		* Support for widgets as replaced objects for form
		  elements. No support for submitting forms etc., this
		  functionality is purely cosmetic.
		* Support for selecting text from the rendered document
		  and copying that text to the clipboard.

	Optional:

		* It would be good to try and figure out how to do the
		  'real' smooth scrolling like IE does. This is a great
		  feature of IE that seems to be overlooked by OS browsers.
		  Is this plausible under X11?
