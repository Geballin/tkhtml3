Caching web objects and DNS lookups

	A previous incarnation of hv3 implemented a simple web and dns
	lookup cache in an SQLite database. That functionality is now
	removed, and the current policy is that hv3 should be run together
	with a local web proxy. If it is not already running, you can start
	squid on most linux installations in non-daemon mode with something 
	like:

		# squid -N -D -d 10

	hv3 is hard-coded to use a web proxy running on the localhost, 
	port 3128. Grep for "3128" in the source if you wish to change this.

Demo Application hv3

	This file describes the Tkhtml demo application hv3, implemented in
	the *.tcl files in this directory. The acronmym 'hv' stands for
	"Html Viewer" (inventive eh?). The '3' indicates Tkhtml version 3.

Functionality

	hv3 is a minimalist web-browser script that uses Tkhtml. The idea
	is to have just enough functionality to test Tkhtml, but it's not
	supposed to be usable as a real browser. The target feature (not
	complete at time of writing) set is:

		* Support for http:// and file:// URIs.
		* Ability to load a new document, either by clicking on a
		  hyper-link or by entering a URI.
		* Support for anchors in documents (i.e. URIs like: 
		  index.html#part1).
		* Support for images, both as replaced objects and in other
		  roles.
		* Support for widgets as replaced objects for form
		  elements. No support for submitting forms etc., this
		  functionality is purely cosmetic.
		* Support for selecting text from the rendered document
		  and copying that text to the clipboard.

Dependencies

	Tcl, Tk, Tcllib and SQLite are required to run the hv3 script. If
	package Img is installed it is loaded.
