	* doc/spec.html: Added two paragraph markers for paragraphs without.

	* src/htmltcl.c (lockcopycmd): Extended to handle HPUX and AIX.

	* src/htmlform.c (HtmlFormIdx, HtmlAddFormInfo): See below, this
	  time branches in a switch.

	* src/htmlwidget.c (TclConfigureWidgetObj, TclConfigureWidget):
	  Fixed syntax, HP compilers do not like label without any
	  statement after them. Inserted semantically no-op to satisfy
	  these demands.

	* started a regular change log.
